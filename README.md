# Flappy Bird Game

This project is a Flappy Bird-like game built using **React**, **Tailwind CSS**, and **React Icons**. The game features a frog character that the player controls to avoid obstacles and collect coins. The goal is to achieve the highest score possible.

## Features

- **Responsive Design**: The game layout adjusts to different screen sizes.
- **Player Controls**: Control the bird (frog) by pressing the space bar to avoid obstacles and collect coins.
- **Obstacles**: Randomly generated walls (pipes) for the player to navigate through.
- **Coins**: Collect coins for bonus points.
- **Gravity**: The bird falls automatically, and the player needs to press space to keep it afloat.
- **Game Over**: The game ends if the bird hits a wall or falls out of bounds.
- **Score**: Keep track of your score as you collect coins and pass through walls.

Technologies Used
React: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
Tailwind CSS: A utility-first CSS framework for styling.
React Icons: Provides the coin and bird icons used in the game.
JavaScript: The logic for the game is implemented in JavaScript.
How It Works
Walls: Generated at regular intervals and move from right to left.
Coins: Appear in the gap between the walls and can be collected for bonus points.
Gravity: The bird is constantly falling due to gravity, and pressing space allows the bird to fly upwards.
Collision Detection: The game checks for collisions between the bird and the walls or coins.
Future Improvements
Add difficulty levels that increase over time.
Implement sound effects and background music.
Enhance the visual design with more animations.
Add a leaderboard to track high scores.
